Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home

"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include


# Whenever some URL comes go in Users.urls instead of 
# directly returning a function and we handle it from there
# this is making it less complex and understandable 

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('',include('Users.urls')),
    path('chat/',include('Chat.urls')), # Chatt app home will be displayed as chat/home

]
